***Air Conditioners EDA Project***

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focusing on air conditioner products from various brands. The project aims to analyze different aspects such as pricing, ratings, energy efficiency, warranty, and more, to provide insights into consumer preferences and market trends.


**Introduction**

Air conditioners are essential appliances for maintaining comfortable indoor temperatures, especially in regions with hot climates. Understanding consumer preferences, pricing strategies, energy efficiency ratings, and warranty offerings is crucial for both consumers and manufacturers in the air conditioning industry.

**Data Collection**

The data for this project was collected from Flipkart, a popular e-commerce platform, using web scraping techniques. The following information was extracted for analysis:

_Brand_

_Price (Discounted and Actual)_

_Available Discount Percentage_

_Rating_

_Annual Consumption (in kWh)_

_Room Size (in sqft)_

_Energy Efficiency Rating (Star Rating)_

_Cooling Capacity (in Ton)_

_Warranty Duration (Compressor and Product)_

**Data Cleaning**

Before conducting the analysis, the collected data underwent cleaning procedures to ensure accuracy and consistency. This included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types where necessary.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

The exploratory data analysis phase involved examining the dataset's characteristics, identifying trends, patterns, and relationships between variables. Descriptive statistics and summary metrics were used to gain insights into the distribution and central tendencies of the data.

**Visualization**

Visualization techniques such as box plots, bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps were employed to visually represent the findings of the analysis. These visualizations helped in conveying key insights effectively and facilitating understanding.


**Conclusion**


The EDA project provided valuable insights into various aspects of air conditioner products, including pricing trends, brand preferences, energy efficiency ratings, and warranty offerings. These insights can be beneficial for consumers in making informed purchasing decisions and for manufacturers in understanding market dynamics and consumer preferences.
